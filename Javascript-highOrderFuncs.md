# Javascript higher order functions and methods : 

Learn the most powerful and most commonly used methods of JavaScript, and learn how to use them in most cases, which will help me solve a lot of problems in a short and elegant way using ES6 arraow functions üòéüòÅ.

**Note 0 :** I highly recommend watching the traversy media tutorial on youtube , he explains these methods in a simple and clear way

## The content - the methods :

- [Foreach](#Foreach)
- [Filter](#Filter)
- [Map](#Map)
- [Sort](#Sort)
- [Reduce](#Reduce)

## Foreach : 
- forEach() calls a provided function once for each element in an array in ascending index order.

- It's not executed for array elements without values (index properties that have been deleted or are uninitialized).

## Filter : 
- The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided by a function).

- It does not execute the function for empty array elements, and does not change the original array.

## Map : 
- The map() method calls a provided function once **for each element** in an array, in order, and constructs a new array from the results.

- map() does not execute the function for empty elements, and does not change the original array.

## Sort : 
- The sort() method allows you to sort elements of an array in place. Besides returning the sorted array, the sort() method changes the positions of the elements in the original array.

## Reduce : 
- The reduce() method executes a reducer function for each value of an array  and returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result.

- reduce() does not execute the function for empty array elements and does not change the original array.
